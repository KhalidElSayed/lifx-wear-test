==============

This is a test app to use lifx bulb remote on android wear


This Application was created for the [Android Wear Hackathon](https://plus.google.com/events/ckeil3ivmdq5qokdmj75tbarpvc) by [GDG DÃ¼sseldorf](https://plus.google.com/107373371386267684213/)


The Idea is pretty simple, when you are connected to a wifi (standing in front of your door at home), notification will be shown and you can turn on your lifx bulb.
